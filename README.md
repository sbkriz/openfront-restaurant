## Core Features

### Point of Sale (POS)
A modern, touch-optimized POS interface for staff to take orders, manage tables, and process payments. Supports complex modifications, split checks, and real-time synchronization with the kitchen.

### Kitchen Display System (KDS)
Streamline your back-of-house operations with a digital KDS. Orders from the POS appear instantly, allowing chefs to manage preparation times, mark items as ready, and coordinate with the front-of-house.

### Table & Seating Management
Visualize your floor plan and manage guest seating in real-time. Track table status (Available, Occupied, Dirty, Reserved) and optimize your restaurant's capacity.

### Menu Engineering
Manage complex menus with categories, products, variants, and modifiers. Set up happy hours, seasonal specials, and digital menus that update across all devices instantly.

### Waitlist & Reservations
Integrated waitlist management with SMS notifications. Allow guests to join the waitlist remotely or at the door, and manage reservations to ensure smooth service.

### AI Assistant
Streamline your restaurant operations with our MCP-powered AI Assistant.
- **Menu Management**: Add new menu items or update prices via natural language.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Mark items out-of-stock or update table status through chat.
- **Permission Safe**: The AI respects your user role's permissions, calling the same API as the POS and Dashboard.
